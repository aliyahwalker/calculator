      <p>Connecticut’s age based COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan has caused confusion amongst residents. Originally, these guidelines were created to lessen the “confusion” about comorbidities caused by the CDC’s guidelines.
      </p>

      <p>In February, Governor Ned Lamont decided to go against the CDC’s guidelines and roll out his own guidance based on age. This new guidance opened up eligibility based on age right before the state was supposed to open up eligibility to
        everyone 16 and older with comorbidities. </p>

      <p> Gov. Lamont chose to branch out from the CDC’s guidelines to provide <a
          href="https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2021/02-2021/Governor-Lamont-Announces-Connecticut-Will-Continue-Age-Based-Approach-To-COVID-Vaccine">“clarity and predictability”</a>. Lamont thought that opening
        eligibility to individuals 16 and older with comorbidities might in the long run slow down vaccination
        distribution. In a press release, Lamont explained that “other previously considered scenarios proved overly complex and confusing.”
      </p>

      <p> This has been a very controversial move, that <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/connecticut-covid-vaccine-eligibility-age-priority-under-65-chronic-conditions/">left a lot of residents and doctors worried </a>about high risk individuals
        who are younger. Many people with comorbidities who were previously eligible to get vaccinated starting in February are
        now being pushed back to be vaccinated with their respective age groups. </p>

      <p>Due to the growing concerns, Gov. Lamont has rolled his plan out faster so that more people are eligible for the vaccine. However in this effort to get more people vaccinated, changes have been made to Connecticut’s guidelines at least once
        a month. This has led to many individuals being confused about when and who can get vaccinated.
      </p>

      <p> Some groups of people are still being prioritized over others, like childcare workers, teachers, and community leaders, which has also added to the confusion. Although Gov. Lamont changed to an age based roll out to simplify any confusions,
        it has in turn <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-age-based-vaccination-rules-come-under-fire-11614940200">increased confusion. </a>The constant changing dates has led to many individuals not knowing when or if they are eligible.
        This has especially affected the minority community where news travels slower. These individuals should be
        prioritized during the vaccination efforts instead of hindered anymore than usually.
